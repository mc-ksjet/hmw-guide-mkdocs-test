# Weapons

Weapons come in a variety of different types. They are normally classed as [external modules](../modules/external/index.md), but fo the sake of being able to find them, have been split out into a separate category here.

Each weapon type has officers and research that affects things like rate of fire, range, and hull & armour damage. Each weapon type also has a specific range and damage profile.

Repair turrets have not been included in this section, but are covered at [Repair Turrets](../modules/external/repair-turrets.md) in the [Modules](../modules/index.md) section.
