# Pulsar Weapons

![Pulsars use the beam weapon icon - a diagonal line going from bottom left to top right](../img/modules/beam-weapon-icon.png)

Pulsar weapons are beam (***not*** energy) type weapons that go *pew zap*. Similar to the ion weapons, they have quite a lot of armour damage and less hull damage compared to the other weapon types, but they have a faster fire rate and different officers then their beam cousins. They have one active abilities called Pulsar Burst (from Operator officers).

They can be buffed by upgrading them, fitting in a high physical stat officer (buffs both hull and armour damage), a pulsar gunner (passive perks) and completing beam research upgrades.

Yaot pulsars have more damage and range, but a lower fire rate compared to the normal / Hiigaran variant.

## Range Details

**Beam Weapons**:

* 100% Damage at close range
* 70% damage & hit chance at 100% range
