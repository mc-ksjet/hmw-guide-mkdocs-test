# Kinetic / Capital Mass Driver Weapons

![Kinetic weapon icon - six small dots arranged in a hexagon](../img/modules/kinetic-weapon-icon.png)

Kinetic or CMD weapons are ballistic weapons that go *bang bang*. With decent hull and armour damage, they are a jack-of-all-trades of the various weapon types. They have two active abilities called Kinetic Burst and EMP Round (from Operator officers).

They can be buffed by upgrading them, fitting in a high physical stat officer (buffs both hull and armour damage), a CMD gunner (passive perks), fitting kinetic heatsinks, fitting kinetic hull or armour damage modules, or completing kinetic research upgrades.

## Range Details

**Small + Medium kinetic turrets**:

* Always do 100% Damage
* Hit chance fall off at a higher range
  * 95% hit chance at 20% range
  * Hit chance falls off with higher range in general
  * For example 86% hit chance at 60% range
  * The biggest falloff is at their highest range (51% for smalls and 53% for mediums)

**Large kinetic turrets**:

* 100% damage everytime
  * Best hit chance at mid range
  * Only 50% hit chanceat close range
  * 75% hit chance at 100% range
  * Around 90% hit chance in between
