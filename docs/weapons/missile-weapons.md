# Missile Weapons

![Missiles use the explosive weapon icon - an eight pointed star](../img/modules/explosive-weapon-icon.png)

Missiles (not to be confused with torpedoes) are explosive weapons that go *fwoosh boom*. With mostly hull damage and very little armour damage, they will shred any unarmoured targets but struggle with armoured enemies. They have two active abilities called Missile Barrage and Fusion Missile (from Operator officers).

They can be buffed by upgrading them, fitting in a high aerospace stat officer (buffs weapon range), a missile gunner (passive perks) and completing missile research upgrades.

## Range Details

* 100% damage at any range

**Small Missiles**:

* Meant for close defense
* High hit chance at close range (until 40%)
* Around 50% hit chance at full range

**Medium & Large Missiles**:

* The opposite of small missiles
* Only 50% (Medium) or 35% (Large) hit chance at close range
* 95% hit rate at 60%+ chance
