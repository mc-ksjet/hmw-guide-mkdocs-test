# Officer list

All officers obtained in the game, except for the named market legendary
officers and the named event officers are now randomly generated, with random
names, random pictures, random stats, and the ability to randonly gain (split)
to a different perk every 10 levels. Due to this, it is no longer possible to
maintain fixed officer lists for any officers other than event and market
officers.
