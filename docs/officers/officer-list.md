# Officer list

All officers obtained in the game, except for the named market legendary officers and the named event officers are now randomly generated, with random names, random pictures, random stats, and the ability to randonly gain (split) to a different perk every 10 levels. Due to this, it is no longer possible to maintain fixed officer lists for any officers other than event and market officers.
