# Active Abilities

Operator officers also can have active abilities. If an officer has a symbol
underneath the stats, it indicates an active ability. For this to be used, a
player needs to place the officer on the bridge and have the right turret
equipped on their flagship. The use of these in battle then costs energy to
activate. Active abilities do not stack.

***Cooldowns on active abilities currently do not appear to work***
