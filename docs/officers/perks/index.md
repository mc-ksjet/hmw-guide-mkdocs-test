# Officer Perks

* Officers with perks will generally outperform a higher stat officer for a
  slotted position
* If you do not have an officer for a certain slot, placing a high stat officer
  in that slot will suffice. For example, placing miners with a high physical
  stat on your turrets is a good alternative if you do not have a gunner with
  the right perk.
* You can stack perks on your bridge slots, for example, 4 officers with
  Fabrication Cost Reduction will work to reduce the costs of all blueprints.
* Although you can place officers in the hanger slot nothing (no stats or perks)
  is currently applied from this slot.
* On a side note, it seems that kinetic / mass driver officers also buff the
  damage for destroyer escorts.

When levelling up officers, you should be aware of the possibility of
[split perks](#split-perks), where the officer gains a second perk.

## Split Perks

When levelling up officers, there is a small possibility that instead of
increasing the stats of the perk, the officer will gain a second perk.

When officers do gain a second perk (referred to as a "split"), it is always
from the same pool of perks in that officer's category. For instance, a gunner
will only ever gain other gunner perks, and miners will only ever gain other
miner perks. Some pools of perks are larger than others (gunners, miners and
pilots have way more perks than Scientists, for instance) and the larger pools
help to ensure that there are more useless perk combinations.

In most cases this splittng to a second perk is undesirable as it effectively
ruins the officer and nullifies the insignia and credits spent on them; the
officer gains a second perk at a mediocre level and leaves the primary perk at
the previous level. In addition, any future levelling becomes a further gamble
becasue which perk is levelled is random.

Officers with two perks **never** develop a third perk and operator officers
**never** gain another active ability. Named market and event officers with two
perks **should** always level the same way for everyone (i.e., not randomly).

There are good combinations of perks to be had but these are not common, for
instance:

* Pulsar/kinetic hull damage officer gaining the pulsar/pinetic armour damage
  perk.
* An operator officer gaining an escort hull damage / armour damage / range
  perk.

There are also debatable combinations of perks that might be useful in some
situations, for example:

* Refinery time officer gaining refinery cost.
* A/B/C ore mining officers gaining perks for other ore types.
* Research production officers gaining research time perks.

While there are some combinations that will want to make you give up, such as:

* Missile hull damage officer gaining the missile armour damage perk.
* Pulsar/Kinetic/Ion hull/armour damage officer gaining missile armour damage
  perk.
* Almost any gunnery officer gaining a perk from a different weapon type.
* Fabrication time officers gaining refinery time perks.
* Fighter squadron hull damage officers gaining corvette based perks (and
  vice-versa).
* Flagship acceleration/speed officers gaining fabrication time perks.
