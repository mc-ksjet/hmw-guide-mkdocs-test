## Sensor: Crit Chance (Star System)

Each time you scan, there is a chance to roll a "critical scan" which reveals
the object for which the crit was rolled immediately (every object gets its own
scanning role when scanning). Increasing your crit chance means there is a
higher likelihood you get these crit rolls.
