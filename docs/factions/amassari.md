# Amassari

The Amassari faction are the degenerated descendants of the formidable Haktar
Empire. Their liaisons are mainly against the
[Kithless Hiigarans](kiithless-hiigaran.md) and other Amassari.

Their siege frigates are to be feared; on their own, they have been known to
one-shot unwary resource collectors, while groups are easily a match for the
hardiest flagship.

## Systems

The Amassari systems are marked in light yellow and can be found beyond the
Nightmare Gulf in the north east of the known galaxy. They share no borders with
any known faction.

For system details, see:

* [T4 Amassari systems](../systems/t4.md#amassari)

## Lore

* The Amassari live amongst the ruins of their shattered empire and
  [Progenitor](progenitor.md) derelicts.
* There is almost no widespread technological advancement among the Amassari
  becasue materials are so scarce.
* The Amassari have lost the knowledge of scientific experimentation.
* They continue on maintaining their ships through a mixture of tradition and
  religious practices.
