# Amassari

The Amassari faction, marked in yellow, are the degenerated descendants of the formidable Haktar Empire. They are focused on the north east beyond the Nightmare Gulf. Their liaisons are mainly against [Kithless Hiigarans](kiithless-hiigaran.md) and other Amassari. Their siege frigates are to be feared; on their own, they have been known to one-shot unwary resource collectors, while groups are eaily a match for the hardiest flagship.

## Lore

* The Amassari live amongst the ruins of their shattered empire and progenitor derelicts.
* There is almost no widespread technological advancement among the Amassari becasue materials are so scarce.
* The Amassari have lost the knowledge of scientific experimentation.
* They continue on maintaining their ships through a mixture of tradition and religious practices.
