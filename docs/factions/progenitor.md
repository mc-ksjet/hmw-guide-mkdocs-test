# Progenitors

Although the Progenitors do not have their own systems (yet?), They can be found in various scannable signals throughout Nimbus.

The Keeper is aware. The Keeper understands. The Keeper has seen the enemy.

They recently went rogue and started attacking all factions of Nimbus but were stopped by the combined forces of the [Hiigaran](hiigaran.md) commanders.

### Lore

This is excluding lore from the main game titles, just what is found on the various loading screen segments.

* There are too many conflicting theories behind the fall of the Progenitor empire to ever conclusively establish what destroyed them.
* Few survive an encounter with a Progenitor keeper. Most that do always accomplish the feat through desperation and outside help.
* It is widely rumored the Progenitors had weapons capable of stupefying levels of destruction. No Progenitor planets have ever been found.
* The Hyperspace Gate network is the most visible and lasting accomplishment of the ancient Progenitor Empire.
* Free standing artifacts that are gate-like have been identified and known for centuries as ‘gates’, but their purpose wasn’t revealed until Aarran was opened.
