# Iyatequa

The Iyatequa faction are mainly traders. They seem to have a close relation with
the [Hiigarans], as can be seen with [Hiigaran] units protecting their stations
and interests. All their systems have liaison offices, and their asteroid belts
seems to be the main target of [Cangacian] pirates.

## Systems

The Iyatequa stations are in the area marked with brown on the galactic map, in
the south west part of the Nimbus galaxay. The have The [Hiigarans] (to their
west), [Cangacians] (to their north), [Tanoch] (to their north east), and [Yaot]
(to their east) as neighbours. They have the most T1 systems of any faction.

## Lore

* The Iyatequa traders are not native to this area. They maintain outposts and
  trade stations but do not have planetary possessions.
* The Iyatequa have little to no respect for outsiders. Every relationship with
  them is transactional.
* The Iyatequaâ€™s reputation as providers extends nearly to all things, and they
  have few ethical standards.
* The Iyatequa can trade in anything, from [Progenitor] relics to slaves and
  access to corrupt politicians.
* The Iyatequa currency database contains thousands of currencies- including
  many from empires that have gone extinct.
* It is widely believed the Iyatequa unmask only in front of family-kind, but
  they do not reveal this information to outsiders.
* Nobody knows how the Iyatequa can see through their masks.
* The Iyatequa masks contain highly complex rank ornamentation, based on merit
  of the trader and accomplishments over their career.
* It is rumored that Iyatequa rank-ornamentation displays debts others owe to
  that particular trader.

### Ghost Stories

#### The Pariah

The Iyatequa are known across Nimbus space as traders and dealers of all kinds
of wares and goods. Generally they are welcomed, even if they are kept at arms
reach, and one can always have goods to buy from them. But there is one Iyatequa
tradesman known as Cosoca the Green with whom you must never barter with.

His deals are fantastic on the surface- promising riches and wealth to those who
would only part with their modest, simple belongings. Too many find out after
their deals that their loved ones at home have disappeared, leaving only scraps
of evidence of what became of them. Even the most guarded individuals who choose
to deal with Cosoca the Green have seen their loved ones vanish without a trace.
It is said Cosoca is a cursed God, trapped in the form of this cursed tradesman,
harvesting souls of the innocent for some great penance he committed in times
forgotten.
