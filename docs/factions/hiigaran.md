## Lore

This is excluding lore from the main game titles, just what is found on the
various loading screen segments.

* One in three Hiigaran expeditions sent through the gates to other galaxies
  fail to return. Nimbus has an exceptionally poor ratio.
* The name for the Nimbus Galaxy originates from the Hiigarans. The name was
  known to the ancients on Hiigara itself.
* The Lazarus Expedition of 9631 GSY was the largest and best-prepared
  expedition sent to Nimbus. It was the only time a full mothership ventured
  there.
* Joanna Naabal was sixteen when the Vaygr bombarded Hiigara. She lived for
  several hours in fear that a Vaygr missile would strike her house.
* Ahab Naabal, father of Joanna, is one of the prominent Hiigaran fleet
  admirals and proponent for Hiigaran unified expeditions.
* Joanna chafed against the safe postings given to her by her father. Two
  rotations in frigate command taught her the vulnerability of these ships.
* Admiral Enoch S’jet was the captain of a destroyer during the final battle
  against the Vaygr over Hiigara.
* To this day nobody is certain where the Vaygr acquired the planet killers
  they used against Hiigara in the final days of the war.
* Vashti Soban left Kiith S’jet because she disagreed with her Kiith’s
  disposition after the war. She believes Karan should have done more to unite
  their people.
* Few know that the Eye of Aarran is damaged. Karan S’jet is said to be seeking
  ways to repair it.
* There are functional hyperspace gate connections not on the network
  controlled by the Eye of Aarran.
