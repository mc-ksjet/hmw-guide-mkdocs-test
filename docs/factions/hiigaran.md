# Hiigarans

**THIS IS YOU**!!

The Hiigaran faction, marked with blue on the galaxy map, staked their claim on the south west of the known galactic map. They are the only faction with access to T0 systems, which are the only locations that have T0 M ore. All systems except their 'capital' system of Lazarus have asteroid belts. But only Lazarus has a trade station with access to a shipyard. The Hiigaran faction currently does not have liaison missions.

T0 systems are the only systems with T0 M ore, this does not need to be refined for use.

## Lore

This is excluding lore from the main game titles, just what is found on the various loading screen segments.

* One in three Hiigaran expeditions sent through the gates to other galaxies fail to return. Nimbus has an exceptionally poor ratio.
* The name for the Nimbus Galaxy originates from the Hiigarans. The name was known to the ancients on Hiigara itself.
* The Lazarus Expedition of 9631 GSY was the largest and best-prepared expedition sent to Nimbus. It was the only time a full mothership ventured there.
* Joanna Naabal was sixteen when the Vaygr bombarded Hiigara. She lived for several hours in fear that a Vaygr missile would strike her house.
* Ahab Naabal, father of Joanna, is one of the prominent Hiigaran fleet admirals and proponent for Hiigaran unified expeditions.
* Joanna chafed against the safe postings given to her by her father. Two rotations in frigate command taught her the vulnerability of these ships.
* Admiral Enoch S’jet was the captain of a destroyer during the final battle against the Vaygr over Hiigara.
* To this day nobody is certain where the Vaygr acquired the planet killers they used against Hiigara in the final days of the war.
* Vashti Soban left Kiith S’jet because she disagreed with her Kiith’s disposition after the war. She believes Karan should have done more to unite their people.
* Few know that the Eye of Aarran is damaged. Karan S’jet is said to be seeking ways to repair it.
* There are functional hyperspace gate connections not on the network controlled by the Eye of Aarran.
