# Tanoch

The Tanoch are an imperial faction that seems to be in a conflict with the
[Yaot]. Their liaisons are mostly based to counter the [Cangacian] pirate and
[Yaot] threats.

## Systems

Tanoch systems are marked in yellow on the galactic map. THey are located to the
north of the known map of Nimbus. They have the [Iyatequa] (to their south west)
and [Yaot] (to the south and south west) as neighbours. They have the most T2
systems of any faction in Nimbus.

## Lore

* The current Tanoch Empire has existed for over eight thousand years.
* The Tanoch believe Star Totek, the Holy Star, contains the dead spirit of one
  of their ancient gods.
* The Tanoch are a deeply religious people, bound by faith to the Priest class
  and the Emperor who is descended from the gods.
* There are three sub-cultures within the Tanoch Empire: The ruling Tanoch, the
  liberal Chicuat, and the downtrodden Tecuban.
* The Temple forces within the Tanoch Empire answer only to Itaca Taot, High
  Priest of the Empire.
* The centuries-long conflict between the [Yaot] and the Tanoch is
  centered on a group of [Progenitor] relics known as the Five Pillars.
* In the Tanoch sky, Star Totek is part of a constellation known as the Eye of
  Xajaak- a creator deity whose hand is said to shape what is.

### Winter Celebrations Event

* The Tanoch Empire is approximately eight thousand years old; records are
  unclear even among the Tanoch themselves. They are currently led by an Emperor
  who is advised by a council of priests and high officials.
* The Tanoch are deeply religious people who are deferral to central authority
  figures and are skeptical of technology. The Tanoch Empire has repeatedly
  crushed dissidents and suppressed technological innovation in order to
  maintain their previous way of life.
* The Tanoch are worshiping the [Progenitors], whom are known as the Makers
  within Nimbus. This worship is prominent across the entire Tanoch culture. At
  certain times, the Tanoch go on a pilgrimage to Star Totek which is said to
  house the spirit of the Makers.
* The Tanoch Empire is compromised broadly of three different ethnic groups. The
  Tanoch now control the Empire and are the most pious. The Tanoch Empire also
  inhibits the Chicuat who are seen as second-class citizens by the Tanoch and
  are often scapegoated of acts of disobedience, and the even lower-class
  Techuban who are survivors of the Tanoch Empire's ancient conquests.
* Recently a beloved Tanoch King died under mysterious circumstances. Therefore,
  the leadership of the Tanoch Empire has passed onto his young son Cazoma.

### Ghost Stories

#### The Gold Fleet

There is a legend among the Tanoch from the old days of conquest, about the
Golden fleet and the Emperor of the time: Altozac the radiant. It is said that
before he bombarded Taldonac VI, the wizard-king of that world put a curse on
Altozac and his fleet. After the surface of Taldonac was turned to molten glass,
the gold fleet jumped to hyperspace and never returned home.

Sightings of the gold fleet have been reported through the millennia, mostly
from a distance. They never respond to hails and they don’t always appear on
sensors, but they are reported as always moving towards Tanochet broadcasting
strange signals. Attempts have been made to discern the fleet’s fate, but no
concrete evidence has ever been found. The only thing that remains of the Gold
Fleet are rumors and sightings across Tanoch space.

#### The Israfil

There are sightings around the Empty Quarter and into Tanoch space of a large
vessel of unknown design, about the size of a destroyer. It shows signs of
damage from a space battle long ago, with the cargo bays breached and the fuel
bays long emptied. Boarding the ship reveals the presence of the long-dead crew,
a sealed compartment impervious to all attempts to breach it, and a low-level
energy signature of indeterminate location. The logs are too jumbled to read
clearly, but it can be learned the ship’s name is the Israfil, it was bound for
a planet called Erarat with a cargo of Raw materials some one million years ago.

There are hundreds of encounters with this ship but never in the same place -
sometimes many thousands of light years from its last reported location. Crews
attempting to salvage the ship often report odd and unsettling occurrences
ultimately driving them from the derelict. The ship has claimed the lives of
over forty salvagers who have vanished when exploring the ship.
