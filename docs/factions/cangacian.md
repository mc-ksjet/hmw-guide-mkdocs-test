# Cangacians

The Cangacian faction, marked in red, made their wretched hives of scum and
villainy in the north west of the known map. They have a special outpost
called 'Safe Haven' that gives you a nice little flavor text when you enter
the system. As you could expect, outside of the safe haven, cangacians seem
to attack you quite a lot in their space. They currently have no liaison
offices, nor should you even be willing to support the pirate menace.

## Systems

The Cangacian systems are marked in red on the galactic map. Their systems are
consist of two areas, split by a narrow corridor os space controlled by the
[Iyatequa]. One area shares borders with the [Hiigarans] (to their south)
and the [Iyatequa] (to their east). The other area is nearby and only shares a
border with the [Iyatequa].

* [T2 Cangacian systems](../systems/t2.md#cangacian)

## Lore

* Many of the Cangacian pirates have ancestry tracing back to the refugees
  from the ancient [Tanoch]wars of conquest.
* The Fleet of Rams is the personal fleet of Supay, Cangacian warlord. His
  ambition is to unite the fringe and invade the [Tanoch] Empire.

### Ghost Stories

#### Whisper Pearls

Scattered through the empty quarter are odd gravity anomalies the Cangacian call
Whisper Pearls. It is believed they are one of the few catalogued gravity
anomalies littered in Nimbus which inhibit casual hyperspace drive
(necessitating stronger engines to conduct hyperspace travel). Whisper pearls
are unusual in that, in addition to their gravimetric properties, they also
broadcast legible transmissions.

Whatâ€™s unsettling about them is that they broadcast signals that have been
trapped there for centuries, possibly millenia. Some of these signals appear to
eminate from long-dead civilizations or starships that have long since been
destroyed. Since the pearls can be found orbiting large stellar masses and other
black-body phenomina invisible to sensors, they have been known to draw would-be
rescuers and the curious to their deaths when they try to steer a quantum wave
towards them to investigate.
