# Cangacians

The Cangacian faction, marked in red, made their wretched hives of scum and villainy in the north west of the known map. They have a special outpost called 'Safe Haven' that gives you a nice little flavor text when you enter the system. As you could expect, outside of the safe haven, cangacians seem to attack you quite a lot in their space. They currently have no liaison offices, nor should you even be willing to support the pirate menace.

## Lore

* Many of the Cangacian pirates have ancestry tracing back to the refugees from the ancient [Tanoch](tanoch.md) wars of conquest.
* The Fleet of Rams is the personal fleet of Supay, Cangacian warlord. His ambition is to unite the fringe and invade the [Tanoch](tanoch.md) Empire.
