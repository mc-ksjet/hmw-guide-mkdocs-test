# Yaot

The Yaot faction, are a mostly unknown faction but seem to be in an aggressive
conflict with the [Tanoch]. Their liaisons are mostly based to counter the
[Cangacian] pirates and [Tanoch] incursions. All systems of the Yaot have
liaison offices.

## Systems

The Yaot systems are marked in green and are located to the south on the known
map of the Nimbus galaxy. They share borders withthe [Iyatequa] (to their west)
and the [Tanoch] (to their north). They have the most T3 systems of all
the factions.

## Lore

* The Yaot Federation is a Gerontocracy, ruled by a council of the eldest from
  every major house. No member is younger than 60.
* The centuries-long conflict between the Yaot and the [Tanoch] is centered on a
  group of Progenitor relics known as the Five Pillars.

### Astral Conjunctions Event

* The Yaot:
  * The Yaot Federation is a technologically advanced gerontocracy galactic
    south of their mortal enemies, the [Tanoch] Empire.
  * Both civilizations are in contention over five massive [Progenitor] relics
    known as the Pillars. This conflict of varying intensity has been going on
    for close to three hundred years.
* The conjunctions:
  * Yaotl, the Home system of the Yaot Federation, is populated with twelve
    planets and over two hundred and twenty asteroids and moonlets.
  * Since ancient days, the Yaot have believed the conjunctions of the different
    planets and stars in their sky forecast signs and portents of events to
    come. Celebrations and festivals are timed to specific conjunctions, making
    it one of the most significant holidays to the Yaot people.
* The Ram:
  * One of the most dire conjunctions of stars in the Yaot sky is the Ram, which
    portents great upheaval on the horizon and a warning to leaders and members
    of the religiously inclined.
  * Three times in the history of the Yaot, great social change and calamity has
    coincided with the appearance of this conjunction.
  * The conjunction is due to appear soon, and many are already worried about
    what tragedy will befall the Yaot people. The council of elders, naturally,
    has dismissed the superstition.
* The government:
  * The Federation is a union of a hundred and eighty or so "old families" which
    are ruled by a council of firstborn elders from each family.
  * No member is younger than sixty, making the council of late increasingly out
    of touch with the needs of the people.
  * Already social unrest from the young is building over resentment of fighting
    a religious war that is increasingly unpopular.
