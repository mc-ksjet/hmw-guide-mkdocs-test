# Yaot

The Yaot faction, marked in green, are a mostly unknown faction but seems to be in an aggressive conflict with the [Tanoch](tanoch.md). They are focused on the south, and have the most T3 systems of any faction. Their liaisons are mostly based to counter the [Cangacian](cangacian.md) pirates and [Tanoch](tanoch.md) incursions. All systems of the Yaot have liaison offices.

## Lore

* The Yaot Federation is a Gerontocracy, ruled by a council of the eldest from every major house. No member is younger than 60.
* The centuries-long conflict between the Yaot and the [Tanoch](tanoch.md) is centered on a group of Progenitor relics known as the Five Pillars.

## Lore (Astral Conjunctions Event)

* The Yaot:
  * The Yaot Federation is a technologically advanced gerontocracy galactic south of their mortal enemies, the Tanoch Empire.
  * Both civilizations are in contention over five massive Progenitor relics known as the Pillars. This conflict of varying intensity has been going on for close to three hundred years.
* The conjunctions:
  * Yaotl, the Home system of the Yaot Federation, is populated with twelve planets and over two hundred and twenty asteroids and moonlets.
  * Since ancient days, the Yaot have believed the conjunctions of the different planets and stars in their sky forecast signs and portents of events to come. Celebrations and festivals are timed to specific conjunctions, making it one of the most significant holidays to the Yaot people.
* The Ram:
  * One of the most dire conjunctions of stars in the Yaot sky is the Ram, which portents great upheaval on the horizon and a warning to leaders and members of the religiously inclined.
  * Three times in the history of the Yaot, great social change and calamity has coincided with the appearance of this conjunction.
  * The conjunction is due to appear soon, and many are already worried about what tragedy will befall the Yaot people. The council of elders, naturally, has dismissed the superstition.
* The government:
  * The Federation is a union of a hundred and eighty or so "old families" which are ruled by a council of firstborn elders from each family.
  * No member is younger than sixty, making the council of late increasingly out of touch with the needs of the people.
  * Already social unrest from the young is building over resentment of fighting a religious war that is increasingly unpopular.
