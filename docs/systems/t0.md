# T0

[Hiigaran](../factions/hiigaran.md) space is currently the only space that
contains T0 systems. These T0 systems are the starter systems that new
commanders find themselves in and only the Lazarus system has a trade station
with access to a shipyard.

All systems in T0 space, except Lazarus have asteroid belts, all of which are
made up ot M ore. These systems are the only place that M ore can be mined. M
ore does not need to be refined in order to use it.

T0 systems do not have access to faction liaison offices or faction liaison
requisitions stores.
