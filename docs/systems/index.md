# Systems

Homeworld mobile is set around a bunch of systems that are owned by various
factions. In this section, there are lists of the various systems, who owns
them, what tier they are, the subtier (crudely known as 'difficulty') of the
system, if they have an Trade station or a outpost, whether there are asteroid
belts, the number of Jovian planets that affect gas starbase gas mining
operations, moons, and what hyperspace jump strength is needed to jump to these
systems.

If you need more details, you should refer to the
[Homeworld_Systems_DB](https://discord.com/channels/855174814108483605/1083774651454455818/1104330056119095346)

Every system above T0 ([Hiigaran](../factions/hiigaran.md)) has access to
faction liaison missions via an outpost or trading station, **except** for
systems belonging to the [Cangacians](../factions/cangacian.md). Only trade
stations have access to a shipyard and faction liaison requisition shop.
