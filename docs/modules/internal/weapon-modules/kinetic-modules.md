# Kinetic Weapon modules

These modules affect all flagship
[Kinetic / Capital Mass Driver Weapons](../../../weapons/kinetic-weapons.md).
The different module types can be categorised as follows:

* **Anti-armour**: Increases the armour damage of a weapon type.
* **Anti-hull**: Increases the hull damage of a weapon type.
* **Heat sink**: Increases weapon turret fire rate, resulting in increases to
  both hull and armour damage.
