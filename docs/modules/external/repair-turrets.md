# Repair Turrets

![Repair turret icon - a spanner holder a nut](/img/modules/repair-turret-icon.png)

Repair turrets are ***armour*** 'healing' turrets that go *brrrt hummmm*. They
will repair units in ***your*** fleet within range if they have damaged armour
and will ignore other friendlies. They have one ability called Repair Burst
(from Operator officers) that will repair a chunk of your armour and also a
chunk of the armour of nearby friendly units.

They can be buffed by upgrading them, completing the relevant research, and
fitting in a high aerospace stat officer (buffs the range of the module).

!!! warning

    using repair turrets will pull a lot of agro towards your flagship when they
    are active. Keep this in mind when doing strikes or harder content.
