# External Modules

External modules are items that are mounted on the exterior of your ship. At
this time, this mainly refers to [repair turrets](repair-turrets.md),
[sensor arrays](sensor-arrays.md) and Weapons. Although weapons are classed as
external modules, they have their own section at
[Weapons](../../weapons/index.md).

Engines could also classed as external modules, but these are currently fixed
to the flagship and cannot be swapped for other engines. Upgrading them boosts
various stats related to your engines.
