# hwm-guide-mkdocs-test

See <https://www.mkdocs.org/getting-started/> for details on how to get started
with mkdics, including how to build the docs and how to deploy.

In order to simply view what this will look like, you can do the following
in Linux without having to build the docs:

1. Install mkdocs with `pip install mkdocs`.
2. Clone this repo locally.
3. Open a terminal and `cd` into the cloned repo.
4. Run `mkdocs serve` in the same folder as the `mkdocs.yml` file.
5. Use a web browser to view <http://127.0.0.1:8000/>

This will autoload the pages as it detects changes to the files.
